# Deeplearning-Based-classification

The model classiffy horse and human using deeplearning model.
An already pretrained model weight is used for predicting the classification
Some of the libraries used are numpy, marplotlib and tensorflow
I was not able to use the opencv in the google colab due to lack of time
so it purely gives the presdiction based on the weights, it predicts the respective image in the tensorflow framework
